# Bystander-Intervention_1
The AI-Powered Bystander Intervention Tool is a mobile application designed to empower bystanders to safely and effectively intervene in social crime situations. It equips
 users with the resources and guidance they need to make a difference, fostering a more secure and supportive community

 Key Functionalities:
 Discreet Activation:
 Voice Command: Users can activate the app with a predefined voice command (e.g., "safeguard") for a discreet approach, avoiding unnecessary attention in potentially dangerous situations.
 SOS Button: 
 A discreet "SOS" button within the app allows for silent activation during a crime. Pre-Registered Emergency Network Users can set up a list of emergency contacts within the
 app. Upon activation (voice command or SOS button), the app sends a pre-defined message,including the user's location, to these contacts, discreetly alerting
 them of a potential situation.

 AI MODELS THAT CAN BE USED 
. Pre-trained Speech Recognition Model: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model  Functionality: This model would be crucial for the "Voice Command" activation
 feature. It would convert spoken words (e.g., "safeguard") into text for the app to  recognize and trigger intervention
 guidance. Functionality: This model (for future versions) could analyze voice recordings from the situation (upon activation) using NLP techniques. It might identify keywords or phrases indicating the nature of the crime  (e.g., shouting, threats) and suggest context aware intervention strategies.
